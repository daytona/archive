Daytona Archive
=======
This is where we store our old repos. When projects are too inactive or too embarrassing to show to the public this is where you should sweep them under the carpet.

1. Clone the repo you want to archive

2. Create a bundle with all brances
```bash
git bundle create nameofrepo.bundle --all
```

3. Add the bundle file to this repo and push it up!

4. Delete the old repo
